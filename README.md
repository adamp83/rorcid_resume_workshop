# Creating a Resume in RStudio using rorcid and ORCID API

** *This file is using github-flavored markdown and should be [viewed in GitHub](https://github.com/pow123/rorcid_resume_workshop/blob/main/README.md)* **
## About the Workshop

### Description:
An ORCID profile is a useful solution to author ambiguity.  It can be used to create an NIH biosketch and help consolidate all your research output in one online profile.  In this advanced workshop, participants will work with the R packages RORCID and VITAE in RStudio to create a resume based on a template ORCID profile.  A basic understanding of R, RStudio, and installing packages is necessary for optimal workshop experience.  Maximum attendance is 25.

### Requirements:
Requires introductory knowledge of R and working with APIs. Requires R and RStudio installed on the computer being used.

### Facilitator:

## Steps

### Access and Setup:
Information about ORCID data can be found at the following links:
- ORCID API Documentation (click ‚ÄúWhat sections can I read on ORCID record using the API?‚Äù) at
  https://info.orcid.org/documentation/api-tutorials/api-tutorial-read-data-on-a-record/#easy-faq-2361
- rorcid walkthrough: https://ciakovx.github.io/rorcid.html

- Rmarkdown Cheat Sheet - https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf
- About ORCID - https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/

‚ùóüî•For the workshop to be successful, the following installations/updates must occur:üî•‚ùó
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) must be updated with version 4.0 or later
- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) must be updated with 1.4 or later
- Install or update **tinytex** using the following steps:
```r
  # To install tinytex
  
 tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
  More help and information is available in [this debugging guide](https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging) and [this StackOverflow answered question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58427254/failed-to-compile-test-tex-see-https-yihui-name-tinytex-r-debugging-for-debu).


### Getting Started:
1. Download the repository from https://github.com/pow123/rorcid_resume_workshop
2. Unzip the folder and rename it from **rorcid_resume_workshop-main** to **rorcid_resume_workshop**.
3. If you'd like to add your headshot, upload it into the **rorcid_resume_workshop** folder. Make sure to save with the filename: `ProfilePic.jpg`.
4. Open RStudio and select ‚ÄúNew Project.‚Äù Then select ‚ÄúExisting Repository.‚Äù
5. Navigate to and select the **rorcid_resume_workshop** directory.
6. Open the `ORCID-CV.Rmd` file.
7. Load the following packages:
  * `library(rorcid)`
  * `library(httpuv)`

*For the libraries you need to install, first use `install.packages()` before loading libraries.*


### Updating Your ORCID Profile:
Visit your ORCID profile and make sure it is up-to-date. You can also use `browse(as.orcid("YourORCID")`, replacing **"YourORCID"** with your ORCID number in quotes, to open your profile from RStudio.

Make sure to provide education and experience and link your ORCID profile with relevant publications.


### Authenticating with ORCID:
7. First, make sure you are logged into ORCID.
8. Next, use `orcid_auth()` and a new browser window will open telling you that authentication was successful and to come back to R.
9. In the console a "Bearer" alphanumeric code will appear. Copy the alphanumeric code.
10. Next, in the console, load the `usethis` package and modify your Renvironment: 
  ```r
  # Input install.packages("usethis") to install the package first.
  # Note: The following will edit the R environment of this project alone, but you can use ‚Äúuser‚Äù instead.
  
  library(usethis)
  usethis::edit_r_environ("project")
```
  
11. A new window will open in the text editor which will be called `.REnviron`.
12. In the new window, write the following:
```r
  # In the line below, replace your_alphanumeric_code below with the one you copied before. 
  # ...and make sure to include the quotation marks!
  
  ORCID_TOKEN="your_alphanumeric_code"
```
13. Next restart your R session. <sup id="a1">[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>


### Updating the Resume Template
The template provided uses the "AwesomeCV" template from the `vitae` R package. After the workshop, you can try different CV options here: https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae/blob/master/README.md

14. To begin updating the info on the resume, make sure you are in the `ORCID-CV.Rmd` file.
15. Next, input your metadata at the top for name, surname, position, address, phone, email, twitter, linkedin, and about me.
16. Throughout the file, make sure to replace the given ORCID with your own ID number by searching for **0000-0001-6229-7514** and replacing it.
17. Load the following libraries now (or load them where they are located in the Rmd file):
 - `rorcid`
 - `tidyverse`
 - `vitae`
 - `dplyr`
 
*For the libraries you need to install, first use `install.packages()` before loading libraries.*

17. Under both ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù and ‚ÄúExperience‚Äù, there are options to use ORCID metadata or to input your own (see the commented out lines in your `ORCID-CV.Rmd` file).
18. Update the ‚ÄúLanguages‚Äù and ‚ÄúSkills‚Äù sections by replacing the examples with your own details.
19. Next, I recommend running the R lines to ensure they work. 
  - Run one line in RStudio by clicking on the line in your file and pressing Ctrl+Enter (or press the ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button). For multiple lines, select the block of code before pressing Ctrl+Enter. 
  - What is occurring: First you store the metadata in a variable (which should appear in your Environment), and then you present it in a table (which should appear in the Rmd file).

| To see a map of arguments: |
|----------------------------|
| `view(rorcid::fields)`     |

20. Once everything runs smoothly, you can Knit the file to create the PDF resume.
